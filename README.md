VSTest
======

A test runner for Google tests under visual (currently uses an old version of google test 
1.6, but I believe only a small amount of work would be needed to make it work 
with newer versions)
this I belive has been suppassed by projects by others so I would look at those 
projects if your looking for a production level runner however the code
is still personally useful to me as it mostly works and is a good example of plugin 
development under visual studio (or least older versions of visual studio). 

This has been migrated from an unfortuantly now defunct svn repo hench the
submit history has been lost.
